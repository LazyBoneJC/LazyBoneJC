I'm a software engineer with a deep passion for the decentralized world. My focus is on building secure, robust, and impactful Web3 applications. I thrive on diving deep into DeFi protocols, hunting for vulnerabilities, and turning complex ideas into clean, efficient code.

My journey from building data-driven backend systems to securing blockchain protocols has given me a strong preventative mindset—always thinking about security and resilience first.

### 🚀 My Main Projects

<details>
<summary><b>💰 DeFi Stablecoin</b></summary>
<br/>
A decentralized, crypto-collateralized stablecoin protocol inspired by MakerDAO's architecture.
<ul>
    <li>Developed a decentralized, crypto-collateralized stablecoin inspired by MakerDAO, implementing core
functionalities like collateral management (WETH & WBTC), minting/burning the stablecoin, and liquidation
mechanics.</li>
    <li>Utilized Foundry for comprehensive testing, including unit tests and property-based fuzzing, to maintain critical
protocol invariants such as overcollateralization.</li>
    <li>Integrated Chainlink Price Feeds with a built-in OracleLib to detect stale prices and freeze the protocol, ensuring
data integrity for the liquidation mechanism.</li>
    <li>Proactively addressed and resolved security vulnerabilities by implementing a non-reentrant guard and analyzing a
Codehawks audit report, gaining deep insight into real-world issues such as arithmetic flaws, business logic risks,
and oracle vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🛡️ Bug Bounty Hunting</b></summary>
<br/>
Passionate about improving Web3 security through active participation in bug bounty programs.
<ul>
    <li>Identified and reported 5 vulnerabilities (3 critical) in the Lido protocol via the Immunefi platform.</li>
    <li>Provided comprehensive reports including root cause analysis, PoCs, and mitigation strategies.</li>
    <li>Continuously study real-world audit reports to stay ahead of emerging threats in the DeFi space.</li>
</ul>
