I'm a software engineer with a deep passion for the decentralized world. My focus is on building secure, robust, and impactful Web3 applications. I thrive on diving deep into DeFi protocols, hunting for vulnerabilities, and turning complex ideas into clean, efficient code.

My journey from building data-driven backend systems to securing blockchain protocols has given me a strong preventative mindset—always thinking about security and resilience first.

### 🚀 My Main Projects

<details>
<summary><b>💰 DeFi Stablecoin</b></summary>
<br/>
A decentralized, crypto-collateralized stablecoin protocol inspired by MakerDAO's architecture.
<ul>
    <li>Architected core smart contracts in Solidity to manage collateral (WETH & WBTC), mint/burn a stablecoin, and handle liquidations.</li>
    <li>Integrated Chainlink Price Feeds with built-in stale price checks to ensure system solvency and oracle reliability.</li>
    <li>Ensured protocol robustness with the Foundry framework, implementing comprehensive fuzz and invariant testing to maintain overcollateralization at all times.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🛡️ Bug Bounty Hunting</b></summary>
<br/>
Passionate about improving Web3 security through active participation in bug bounty programs.
<ul>
    <li>Identified and reported 5 vulnerabilities (3 critical) in the Lido protocol via the Immunefi platform.</li>
    <li>Provided comprehensive reports including root cause analysis, PoCs, and mitigation strategies.</li>
    <li>Continuously study real-world audit reports to stay ahead of emerging threats in the DeFi space.</li>
</ul>
